Each monster in Silent Hill is a literal 
representation and manifestation of one of the 
characters' guilt. Characters such as James and 
Heather ate dealing with harrowing ramifications to 
past events and thus bear the scars of their 
memories. The next time you play a Silent Hill game, 
just remember that the monster you ate fleeing from 
is a true nightmare.
